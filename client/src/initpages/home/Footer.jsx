              Investing in U.S. Treasuries securities (“Treasuries”) involves
              risks, including but not limited to, interest rate risk, credit
              risk, and market risk. Although Treasuries are considered safer
              than many other financial instruments, you can still lose all or
              part of your investment. Early withdrawal or sale prior to
              maturity of Treasuries may result in a loss of principal or impact
              returns. Reinvestment into new Treasuries is subject to market
              conditions and may result in different yields. As a general rule,
              the price of Treasuries moves inversely to changes in interest
              rates. Before investing, you should consider your tolerance for
              these risks and your overall investment objectives. For more
              details, see Multicoin Advisors’ Form ADV Part 2A.
